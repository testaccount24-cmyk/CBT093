ISPF stats (in the pds directory entry) have packed number fields:
They are "create date" and "last changed date".

These are always positive numbers, and it seems (from our inquiring of
ISPF developers), that the sign bit in these numbers is always X'0F'.
However, X'0C' is also valid for a positive packed decimal number.

Several user programs have had trouble when X'0C' is the sign.
One of these programs has been OFFLOADW.  OFFLOADW would not produce
./ADD NAME cards containing ISPF statistics information, if the sign
bit of these numbers was X'0C'.  Therefore, in OFFLOADW 10.2, the
program was modified to turn all of the X'0C' numbers to X'0F'.

The change was made in July 2022 by "Mr. Updater", who in reality, is
an extremely skilled Assembler programmer (and a very good guy).
